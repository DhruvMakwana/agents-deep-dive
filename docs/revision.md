# Revision

Every page's TL;DR in one place, every page's Scenario Check merged into one combined quiz, and a flashcard deck for fast recall drilling — for a quick pass before an interview instead of clicking through pages one at a time.

!!! note "Kept in sync manually"
    This page is generated from the TL;DR and Scenario Check blocks on every content page by `scripts/generate_revision.py`, re-run after editing any page's TL;DR or quiz — it isn't live-generated on every build.

=== "All TL;DRs"

    ## Foundations

    ### [What Is an Agent?](what-is-an-agent.md)

    - **The defining property isn't "uses an LLM."** Anthropic's working definition: a **workflow** is a system where "LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths"; an **agent** is a system where "LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage." The line is *who decides the next step* — fixed code, or the model.
    - **A retry-on-failure loop written in application code is still a workflow, not an agent**, under this definition — Anthropic's own evaluator-optimizer pattern (generate, grade, loop until a criterion is met) is listed as a *workflow*, because the LLM isn't the one deciding whether or how to retry.
    - **Definitions genuinely disagree at the edges.** Simon Willison: "an LLM agent runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal." Chip Huyen: something that perceives and acts on an environment. OpenAI: "systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf." None of these are wrong; they draw the line in slightly different places, and a strong interview answer names the disagreement rather than picking one as *the* definition.
    - **Most systems marketed as agents aren't, by any of these definitions.** Menlo Ventures' December 2025 enterprise survey found only 16% of enterprise and 27% of startup deployments calling themselves "agents" actually qualify as one — most are "if-then logic around a model call."
    - **A worked trace beats a definition in an interview.** This page's own demo shows the same misclassification happening in both a workflow and an agent — the difference isn't that the agent classifies better, it's that the agent has a step where it can act on its own doubt, and the workflow structurally doesn't.

=== "Combined Scenario Check"

    4 questions from every page on this site, one combined pass instead of opening each page separately. Every question shows which page it's from — go re-read that page for anything you get wrong.

      "questions": [
        {
          "scenario": "A support system does classify -> retrieve -> generate over 50 FAQ categories, chosen by embedding similarity. When the best match's similarity score falls below a fixed threshold, the code shows the customer 3 candidate articles instead of generating one answer.",
          "question": "Does the threshold branch make this system an agent?",
          "options": [
            "Yes \u2014 showing multiple candidates instead of one means the system is adapting its behavior to retrieval quality, which is the decision-point behavior that defines an agent",
            "No \u2014 the branch (one answer vs. three candidates) is triggered by a fixed numeric threshold check in code, not by the model choosing what to do next based on its own judgment",
            "It depends on whether the embedding model or the generation model owns the threshold",
            "Yes, because the system now has more than one possible output path depending on the input"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanations": [
            "This is the tempting trap: the system's output genuinely does vary with live data (the similarity score), which sounds like the 'depends on the outcome of a previous action' criterion. But varying output isn't the same as the model deciding \u2014 a lookup table that branches on a number is still just a lookup table, however adaptive it looks from outside.",
            "Correct. A fixed threshold in code is choosing the next step, not the model. Nothing here lets the model itself decide what happens next based on its own read of the situation \u2014 replace the threshold with any other number and the architecture is identical.",
            "The threshold lives in application code either way, regardless of which model's score it reads \u2014 this doesn't change who's making the branching decision.",
            "Multiple possible output paths is necessary but nowhere near sufficient \u2014 a large if/elif chain has many output paths and is still a workflow. The test is who picks the path at runtime, not how many paths exist."

        },
        {
          "scenario": "A pipeline generates an answer, then makes a second LLM call asking 'Is this answer good enough? Reply yes or no.' If the reply is 'no,' the code regenerates once more (hard-capped at 2 total attempts) and returns whichever attempt was produced last, regardless of what the second judgment says.",
          "question": "Where does this system sit?",
          "options": [
            "It's an agent \u2014 an LLM is making the 'good enough' judgment, and that judgment is a real decision",
            "It's a workflow \u2014 the LLM's yes/no only gates a branch that fixed code already wired in (retry once, then stop and return whatever you have); the model never gets to choose a different action, only fill in a pre-built slot",
            "It's an agent on the second attempt only, since that's the point where branching happens",
            "It's ambiguous, and the answer depends on which provider is used for the judgment call"
          ],
          "correct": 1,
          "explanations": [
            "This is the most common wrong intuition on this whole page: an LLM call is involved in the decision, so it feels agentic. But this is exactly the pattern Anthropic names 'evaluator-optimizer' and classifies as a workflow \u2014 the LLM fills in a yes/no gate whose consequences (retry once, cap at 2, return regardless of the second verdict) were fully decided by the code author in advance.",
            "Correct. The action space here has exactly two pre-wired outcomes (retry once, or don't), chosen by code, not model-selected from live options. Compare this to this page's own recipe: the judge step there feeds into a decision where the model picks among BROADEN/CLARIFY/ESCALATE \u2014 a genuinely open action set, not a single fixed retry slot.",
            "Branching happening at a specific point doesn't retroactively make earlier or later steps agentic or non-agentic \u2014 the whole system is one architecture, evaluated by the same rule throughout.",
            "The provider generating the yes/no token is irrelevant to this distinction \u2014 the question is about who controls the consequence of that token, and that's fixed code regardless of vendor."

          "scenario": "An interviewer describes a system: 'We handle exactly 12 known customer request types. For each, there's one verified, deterministic procedure to follow, and the correct order of steps never depends on what happens during execution.' They ask whether you'd build this agentically.",
          "question": "What's the strongest response?",
          "options": [
            "Build it as an agent anyway \u2014 future request types outside the current 12 might appear, so agent flexibility future-proofs the system now",
            "Build it as a workflow \u2014 the correct procedure for each of the 12 cases is already known and doesn't branch on live results, so an agent's dynamic decision-making adds cost, latency, and non-determinism without buying anything this task needs; revisit the decision if and when new request types actually appear",
            "It must be an agent, because customer-facing workflows are inherently unpredictable",
            "Build it as an agent, because letting the model choose the procedure is more reliable than hard-coded step selection on a fully known task"

          "correct": 1,
          "explanations": [
            "A real and common engineering trap \u2014 over-building for imagined future flexibility the task doesn't currently need. If new request types show up later, that's the moment to reconsider, not a reason to pay agentic costs today for a fully solved, fully verified problem.",
            "Correct. This is the 'When you would not build an agent' trade-off from this page, applied to a concrete case instead of asked in the abstract \u2014 the task is fully known and doesn't need branching on live feedback, so a fixed pipeline is strictly more reliable and cheaper here.",
            "An unfounded generalization \u2014 the scenario explicitly states the procedures are verified and deterministic. 'Customer-facing' doesn't imply unpredictable; the two are independent.",
            "False, and worth catching directly: an LLM choosing among known, verified procedures is not more reliable than the verified procedures themselves \u2014 on a fully known task, hard-coded logic doesn't fail in the ways a model's live judgment can."

          "scenario": "A candidate is asked how LLM agents improve over a deployment's lifetime, given they don't get gradient updates from a reward signal the way RL agents do. The candidate answers: 'They don't really improve \u2014 each session starts fresh with the same weights, so there's no real analog to RL's learning.'",
          "question": "What's the best critique of this answer?",
          "options": [
            "The candidate is basically right \u2014 without fine-tuning, there's no improvement mechanism at all",
            "The candidate is missing the in-context mechanisms (reflection notes, accumulated memory, refined tools/prompts carried forward across sessions) plus the fact that RL-style training (GRPO, DPO on trajectories) is increasingly applied on top of the deployed loop, not as a one-time pretraining step",
            "The candidate is wrong because model weights are automatically updated after every conversation",
            "The candidate is right for closed-source models but wrong for open-weight models, which retrain continuously between sessions"

          "correct": 1,
          "explanations": [
            "Partial credit at best: it's true no gradient update happens mid-session, but the candidate is answering a narrower question than the one asked \u2014 the interviewer asked about improvement across a deployment's lifetime, not within one session.",
            "Correct \u2014 and it's the exact bridge this page's RL-vs-LLM-agent table points to: session-to-session improvement happens through what persists in context (reflection, memory, tool refinement) and, increasingly, through RL applied on top of the already-deployed agent loop rather than as a separate pretraining phase.",
            "A common but flatly false belief \u2014 no mainstream deployed LLM updates its own weights automatically mid-conversation or between sessions from ordinary usage.",
            "Also false, and a plausible-sounding trap for the same reason as the option above \u2014 open-weight availability has no bearing on whether a specific deployment retrains itself; most don't, open or closed."
